# Build log

An editorial layer on top of git history across every project under
`~/sites/personal-projects`. Commits are the source of truth; this file is
"what changed and why it matters to someone who doesn't have the repo open" —
the raw material for weekly social posts.

- **Written by:** the `social-log` skill, triggered by a `PostToolUse` hook after
  every commit. The hook drops a `status: stub` block; the skill rewrites it
  into an enriched entry.
- **Read by:** the `social-draft` skill, weekly, to draft posts.
- Newest entry first. Once this file gets long, older years move to `log/2026.md`.

Entry format lives in
`Skills/agent-skills/social/social-log/reference/entry-format.md`.

**What:** Fixed a blind spot in the automation that logs my work: when I commit
with a one-liner like `cd other-project && git commit`, the session's working
directory never actually changes, so the logger was looking at the wrong repo
and silently skipping the commit. It now also scans all my project folders for
whichever one's latest commit just happened, and catches it.
**Why it matters:** I built this whole "log every commit so I can post about it
later" system a day ago, then immediately watched three of my own commits slip
through the cracks because of how I habitually type git commands. Kind of the
whole point of building in public — the tool meets real usage and the seams
show. This one's fixed; the log caught this very commit (the one adding the
fix) on the first try.
**Shareable:** yes — screenshot of the BUILD-LOG.md entry that logged its own
fix, side by side with the terminal showing the `cd … && git commit` that
triggered it.

**What:** Rebuilt the route-drawing map screen in Move/Think — tap-to-plot
waypoints on a full-screen map with a distance readout that updates live,
controls that finally match the rest of the app's look, and a plain
read-only route viewer when you're just looking back at a past run instead
of editing it.
**Why it matters:** This screen had been a rough edge for a while — wrong
colors, markers invisible on light maps, and losing the app's own nav bar
after backing out of it. It now matches the app's actual design language
(same circular buttons as every other detail screen, same dot style as the
mood slider) and the route line/markers automatically flip black or white
so they're always visible against the map, in light or dark mode.
**Shareable:** yes — before/after of the route editor (purple line on dark
map vs. black line on light map), the floating controls close-up, and the
new read-only full-screen route view.
